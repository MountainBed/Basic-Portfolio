        <p>
            I was born July 6th, 1989. My mother was a bartender and my father was a teacher, but both have since retired. From an early start, I have always liked to express my creativity in different ways. I started with paint and pencil, then moved to woodworking. Now I am trying my hand at web design!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I am an avid video gamer. I also enjoy experiencing new food, whether it be in my own kitchen, or at some new restaraunt. I live with my girlfriend of 9 years in a stupid apartment.
